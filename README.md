# Tic Tac Toe Game

In this project I will create a Tic Tac Toe game using only <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>

I will try to follow a pattern on commits and document implementations with comments.

This is my first personal project attempt ðŸ˜ƒ
Also i won't be working with branches, commits and pushes will be on main branch.
It's a small project so I won't bother with that right now.
